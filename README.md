Ive used a Kmeans clustering process to divide the given IPL data into different clusters.
To derive number of clusters ive used the methodology of Elbow charts.
For visualization purposes ive decided to use various visualization libraries like matplotlib.pyplot and plotly.
Matplotlib has helped be plot basic charts so that i can easily visualize things im working with whereas Plotly has helped me visualize advanced charts for ease of use.
For modelling purposes ive used the Sklearn library to import various prebuilt algorithms like K-means, scalers, and splitting of data into various test train splits.
Pandas and Numpy libraries have helped me with importing my data and work on them in a seamless manner.
